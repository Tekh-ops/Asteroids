ASTEROIDS

An implementation of the classic asteroids game using a custom game engine
written in C++ using OpenGL for graphics.

The game engine uses a hybrid component architecture - inheritance system.
Features include a sprite component, animated sprite component, AI system
that utilises a state machine and pathfinding and movement controls. This game
engine has been adapted from my previous engine used for my Fox Hunt project
which used SDL graphics and now uses OpenGL instead.
